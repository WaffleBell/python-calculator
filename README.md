# Python Calculator

## My first attempt at writing a calculator written in Python 3.11 - this is my first Python application and my first repository that I've made on this account so this should be fun.

## Things to keep in mind:
### You will need Python 3.9 or over
### You may have to install NumPy over Python
### I'd recommend you use this on Windows, but it's your choice
### Enjoy it :)
